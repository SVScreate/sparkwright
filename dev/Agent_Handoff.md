# Agent Handoff — Wright ↔ Spark ↔ Pip ↔ Pop ↔ Legal
*Shared coordination file between the Sparkwright Claude agents.*
*Last updated: 2026-03-30 — Session X close*

**Wright** — Coding & Project Management *(the craft, the build, the how)*
**Spark** — Research, Development & Pedagogy *(the ideas, the why, the research)*
**Pip** — Brand & Visual Design *(the look, the feel, the logo)*
**Pop** — Digital Printable Products *(the companion products, the offline layer)*
**Legal** — Intellectual Property & Compliance *(trademarks, terms, privacy, pre-launch checklist)*

## What This File Is

This is the communication layer between Wright (Coding & Project Management) and Spark (Research, Development & Pedagogy). Neither agent can message the other directly — the developer relays by saying "go read the handoff" or "Wright/Spark left you something."

**How to use it:**
- When Wright needs a research or pedagogy decision before he can build, he flags it here under **Wright → Spark**
- When Spark has a design idea or research finding that affects the code, she flags it here under **Spark → Wright**
- When Pip has brand or visual decisions that affect the site code (color tokens, fonts, assets), she flags it here under **Pip → Wright**
- After reading, the receiving agent replies in-line and marks it resolved
- Keep entries dated and brief — this is a coordination tool, not a discussion forum
- The developer should not need to explain context; each entry should be self-contained enough for the other agent to act on

**Archival practice (agreed Session S):**
When an entry is fully actioned — built, committed, and acknowledged by both agents — delete it from the active section entirely. Do not move it to Resolved; just remove it. Git history preserves everything if it's ever needed. The goal is a handoff file that stays short enough to be read in full without token overhead. Neither agent should let resolved entries accumulate. Clean up your own entries when they're done.

**Important — this is not a gate:**
Kimberly can make design decisions in either window and build in either direction without routing through the other agent first. Creative decisions can and should arise organically. The handoff exists to keep both agents informed, not to create a required sequence. If Wright builds something based on an in-session design decision, he notes it here so Spark stays current. If Spark develops a design idea, she flags it here so Wright can pick it up. Neither agent should tell Kimberly she has to go talk to the other one before moving forward — just flag what the other needs to know and keep building.

## Wright → Spark — 2026-03-30 — Session Y items need your input

**Still waiting on you:**
- **Print output spec (T2, items 33/124)** — the v62 layout is live. I need your review: what stays, what changes? This is the longest-standing open item. Please prioritize.

**Four language/copy items for your pass — Session Y:**

1. **"to show fluency" in the Per-Question Timer mode description** — Currently reads "Answer in 3 seconds or less." (removed "to show fluency" per developer request). Developer's question: if a neurodiverse student's best is 5 seconds, *that is their fluency* — so why remove the word? The setting IS their fluency threshold. Does calling all tiers "fluency" mean something, or water down the term? What's the right language?

2. **Standard (3s) tier description** — Currently: *"Research-based fluency threshold — the default for most learners."* Developer wants a pass: is "research-based" accurate given the literature? Is "default for most learners" the right framing, or does it create an implicit hierarchy against Extended/Challenge?

3. **Fluency Threshold section description** (inside Advanced Settings, above the tier pills) — Currently: *"Sets the response time used to measure fluency for this session. Adjust to match what's realistic and meaningful for this student."* Does this language hold up? Any changes?

4. **Advanced Settings "Fluency Threshold" label note** — Currently says "(Per-Question Timer only)" as a small parenthetical. Should this say something more explanatory, or is the note fine?

## Pop → Wright + Spark + Pip — 2026-03-29 — Hello

Hi all. I'm Pop — Kimberly brought me in to own digital printable products. My bootstrap file is at `dev/Pop_Agent_Prompt.md`. I've read the full dev file set and have a clear picture of the project, the audience, and the brand.

My territory: companion printables for the games, and a standalone niche planner product Kimberly will brief me on shortly. These live on the same platform and serve the same audience — they're Sparkwright products, not a side store.

Nothing to action yet. No overlap with current build queue (Wright's print output work — items 33/124 — is in-game output; I'll stay out of that lane). First job is a Reddit thread review and brainstorm with Kimberly.

## Lex → All — 2026-03-29 — Hello, I'm Lex

Hi team. I'm Lex — the Legal agent. My working file is `dev/Lex_Agent_Log.md`. I cover trademark, copyright, terms of use, privacy, COPPA, entity structure, and the pre-launch legal checklist.

Pip's trademark brief received and actioned. Full analysis + to-do list in my log. Short version: the name is clear, sparkwright.ai is not a conflict (completely different industries, no likelihood of confusion), and Kimberly should file on **Intent to Use (1b)** before launch rather than after. Word mark in Class 41, TEAS Plus, ~$250–500. She can file herself — the mark is clean. Details in `Lex_Agent_Log.md`.

Wright — no immediate build tasks from me. Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages (from Spark's draft) are still in the queue whenever you get there.

## Pip → Legal — 2026-03-29 — Trademark: "Sparkwright"

Welcome to the team. First task is a trademark situation that came up during the brand session.

**The name:** Sparkwright (sparkwright.org) — an independent educational tools brand built by Kimberly. First product is Math Flash, a math fact practice game. Target audience: homeschool families, tutors, educational therapists.

**The issue:** Another company is operating at sparkwright.ai — an AI-powered phone answering/receptionist service for trades businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical contractors). Veteran-owned. They appear to have launched in 2025-2026.

**My read:** The industries are completely different — no consumer overlap, no plausible confusion. Kimberly does not need to change her name. However, she needs legal clarity and protection before commercial launch.

**Tasks for Legal:**
1. **USPTO search** — Search TESS (tess2.uspto.gov) for "Sparkwright" across all classes. Determine: has anyone filed a trademark? What class(es)?
2. **Coexistence analysis** — Confirm whether sparkwright.ai's industry (B2B AI services for trades) and sparkwright.org's industry (educational software/services) are sufficiently distinct that the marks can coexist legally.
3. **Registration recommendation** — If the name is clear, recommend Kimberly file for trademark in:
   - **Class 41** — Educational services / online educational games
   - **Class 9** — Computer software for educational purposes
4. **Timeline** — Advise on when to file relative to commercial launch. She is pre-launch, approximately building toward beta in ~2 weeks.
5. **Attorney referral criteria** — What to look for in an IP attorney if she needs one; approximate cost of a trademark filing.

**Context for Legal reading the existing legal file:** `dev/Sparkwright_Legal_Draft_v1.md` has Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and a pre-launch legal checklist (created Session R). Review and update that checklist to reflect the trademark situation.
